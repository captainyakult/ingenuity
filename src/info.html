		<h1>Entry, Descent and Landing</h1>
		<h2 class="semi">Pre-landing visualization</h2>
		<p>This is a real-time simulation of the planned entry, descent, and landing of the Mars 2020 mission, which will land the Perseverance rover at Jezero crater on Mars on February 18th, 2021. On the day of the event itself, the timeline may be slightly different, but this represents the expected set of events using the best available engineering data.</p>
		<p>We recommend using a broadband internet connection, and to use the newest hardware/software available for the best performance. Older phones and tablets in particular can perform sluggishly. <p> Once the Perseverance rover lands on Mars, you can click the “Replay” button to start again at the beginning. If you are watching it live, the button will say “Live,” and if you fast-forward or rewind you will need to click on “Back to Live” to go back to real-time.</p>

		<p>The settings buttons on the bottom right allow you to change from the English system to the metric system, i.e., miles to kilometers <span class="icon icon-mi inline"></span>. The “eye” icon <span class="icon icon-hide inline"></span> will completely remove the interface. Next, you have the controls for zooming in and out, followed by a “floodlight” lighting option <span class="icon icon-box inline"><span class="icon icon-flood-light"></span></span>. Finally, you can go fullscreen with the last button<span class="icon icon-fullscreen inline"></span>.</p>
		
		<p>To control time, scroll up and down on the description text itself to advance to the next or previous stage. You can also change the time rate using the fast-forward and rewind buttons on the bottom center of the screen, or type in the time that you want directly. To zoom in and out, either use the <span class="icon icon-box inline"><span class="icon icon-plus"></span></span> and <span class="icon icon-box inline"><span class="icon icon-minus"></span></span> buttons on the bottom right or use the “W” and “S” keys, or use the scroll wheel of your mouse. To track around the spacecraft (yaw/heading), use the “A” and “D” keys. To rotate (roll) the view, use the “Z” and “C” keys. You can also just click and drag with your mouse.</p>
		
		<h5 class="semi color gray">Mobile</h5>
		
		<p>Use your finger to swipe up or down on the text description to advance to the next stage or go back to the previous stage. When you tap above the text area, you can hold down your finger to move around the spacecraft. You can also pinch to zoom. Once you do that, you bring up the time controls. If you don’t need to pause or change the time rate, then you just tap the left arrow button to go back to the text description.</p>
		
		<p>Landscape mode is supported; turn your phone sideways to change the view.</p>
